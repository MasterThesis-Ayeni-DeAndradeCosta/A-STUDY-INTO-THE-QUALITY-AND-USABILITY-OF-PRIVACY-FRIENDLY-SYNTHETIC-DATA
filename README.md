# A-STUDY-INTO-THE-QUALITY-AND-USABILITY-OF-PRIVACY-FRIENDLY-SYNTHETIC-DATA

1. Benchmarks:
  results from original dataset
    - F1-score
    - K-S test
    - accuracy (sometimes not relevant)
    - Precision 
  
3. Define preprocessing
   -encoding categorical columns (define priorities)
   -removing empty and null values
   -remove special characters
   -remove outliers
   
5. Parallel Pipelines
  -working with config file to swap easily between different libraries
   
7. Utility
   -ML models: logistic regression, svm, random forest, decision tree

9. Analysis
  -display metrics of each dataset
